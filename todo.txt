Plot full journey in each reference frame: home, traveller, tob, tib
Plot full journey with time as the independent variable instead of distance, again in each reference frame
Include light signals between twins in all plots
Write a function that transforms one frame to another when the origins are not coincident; solution:
    Suppose A at (0,0) coincides with B at (-1,-1)
    Let B' = B + (1,1), i.e. the origins of A and B' coincide
    Transform A => B using Lorentz transform
    Transform B => B' using additive transform above
Write a function that transforms for cases of contraction, and rename new_frame
